Definition list_elim A P : P nil -> (forall x xs, P xs -> P (cons x xs)) -> forall xs, P xs :=
  fun H__nil H__cons xs => @list_rect A P H__nil H__cons xs.

Lift list vector in list_elim as vect_elim.

Check (vect_elim :
         forall (A : Type) (P : {n : nat & vector A n} -> Type),
           P (0; vnil A) ->
           (forall (x : A) (xs : {n : nat & vector A n}),
               P xs.& -> P (S xs.1; vcons A x xs.1 xs.2)) ->
           forall (xs : {n : nat & vector A n}),
             P xs.&).

Lift Module list vector in List' as Vector' { opaque (* ignore these, just for speed *)

(*
 * There are still two proofs (`partition_length` and `elements_in_partition`)
