This is DEVOID, a plugin for automatic discovery of and lifting across 
certain equivalences between types in Coq.
DEVOID is a part of the [PUMPKIN PATCH](https://github.com/uwplse/PUMPKIN-PATCH) 
proof repair plugin suite, and is included as a dependency of PUMPKIN PATCH
starting with release 0.1.
We call the current version of PUMPKIN PATCH with support for equivalences through DEVOID "PUMPKIN Pi."

Given two types A and B that are related in certain ways, DEVOID can search for
and prove the relation between those types, then lift functions and proofs between them.
The following relations are currently supported automatically:

1. **Algebraic Ornaments**: the type B (like `vector`) is the type A (like `list`) indexed by a fold
over A (like `length`)
2. **Records and Tuples**: the type A is a nested tuple of the form `x * (y * ...)`, and the type B is
a record with the same number of fields that have the same types
3. **Swapping and Renaming Constructors**: the types A and B are two inductive types that are equal up to
swapping constructor order and renaming constructors
4. **Escaping Sigma Types**: the type B (like `vector T n`) is the type A (like `{ s : sigT (vector T) & projT1 s = n}`) 
escaping the sigma type

In general, DEVOID can lift functions and proofs across **any equivalence that can be described by a configuration with a certain form**.
For change that don't fall into the above four buckets, you need to supply the configuration for that equivalence yourself.
This is not yet documented here due to time constraints (I promise I will document it soon).
For now, check out two examples: switching between unary and binary natural numbers [here](/plugin/coq/nonorn.v),
and an easier refactoring of constructors [here](https://github.com/uwplse/ornamental-search/blob/master/plugin/coq/playground/constr_refactor.v).

# Getting Started with DEVOID

This section of the README is a getting started guide for users.
Please report any issues you encounter to GitHub issues, and please feel free to reach out with questions.

## Building DEVOID

The only dependency you need to install yourself in order to use DEVOID is Coq 8.8. 
DEVOID also depends on a
[Coq plugin library](https://github.com/uwplse/coq-plugin-lib) which is included
as a submodule automatically in the build script,
and on the [fix-to-elim](https://github.com/uwplse/fix-to-elim) plugin, which is also included. To build DEVOID, run these commands:

```
cd plugin
./build.sh
```

## Using DEVOID

For an overview of how to use the tool, see [Example.v](/plugin/coq/examples/Example.v)
and [minimal_records.v](/plugin/coq/minimal_records.v).

### Overview

At a high level, there are two main commands: `Find ornament` to search for equivalences,
and `Lift` (or `Repair` for tactic support) to lift along those equivalences. `Find ornament` supports two additional options
to increase user confidence and to make the functions that it generates more useful.
If you skip running the `Find ornament` command and just run `Lift`,
then DEVOID will run `Find ornament` for you automatically first.

In addition, there are a few commands that help make DEVOID more useful: `Preprocess`
for pattern matching and fixpoint support, and `Unpack` to help recover more user-friendly types.
The `Preprocess` command comes from our plugin
[fix-to-elim](https://github.com/uwplse/coq-plugin-lib).
There is also work in progress on a general methodology (which will hopefully be automated in
the future) to get even more user-friendly types.

#### Search

See [Search.v](coq/examples/Search.v) for an example of search.

##### Command

```
Find ornament A B as A_to_B.
```

This command searches for the relation between A and B.

##### Outputs 

For algebraic ornaments, `Find ornament` returns three functions if successful: 

1. `A_to_B`,
2. `A_to_B_inv`, and 
3. `A_to_B_index`.

`A_to_B` and `A_to_B_inv` form a specific equivalence, with `A_to_B_index` describing the fold over `A`.

For other kinds of ornaments, `Find ornament` returns only the first two of these.

##### Options for Correctness

`Find ornament` supports two options. 
By default, these options are disabled.
Together, setting these two options tells `Find ornament` to prove that its outputs are correct.

```
Set DEVOID search prove coherence.
```

For algebraic ornaments, this option tells `Find ornament` to additionally generate a proof `A_to_B_coh` that shows that
`A_to_B_index` computes the left projection of applying `A_to_B`.

```
Set DEVOID search prove equivalence.
```

This option tells `Find ornament` to generate proofs `A_to_B_section` and `A_to_B_retraction` that
prove that `A_to_B` and `A_to_B_inv` form an equivalence.

##### Using Custom Equivalences

If `Find ornament` fails or you would like to use an existing equivalence, you can run this
command before lifting:

```
Save ornament A B { promote = f; forget = g}. 
```

where `f` and `g` form an equivalence that describes one of the supported relations between `A` and `B`.
Note that support for this is extremely experimental, and will not yet work if you try this with unsupported
relations. You can find an example in [TestLift.v](/plugin/coq/TestLift.v).

You can also use this to substitute in a different equivalence for an existing ornament, but again there
are some restrictions here on what is possible. See [ListToVectCustom.v](/plugin/coq/examples/ListToVectCustom.v)
for more information.

You can also skip one of promote or forget, provide just one, and let DEVOID find the other for certain search procedures, for example:

```
Save ornament A B { promote = f }.
```

This is especially useful when there are many possible equivalences and you'd like to use a particular one,
but let DEVOID figure out the rest. See [Swap.v](/plugin/coq/Swap.v) for examples of this.

To use a custom equivalence not at all supported by one of the four search procedures, like switching between unary and binary natural numbers,
check out two examples [here](/plugin/coq/nonorn.v) and [here](https://github.com/uwplse/ornamental-search/blob/master/plugin/coq/playground/constr_refactor.v).
These examples set manual configuration and essentially skip the search procedure.
We will document them soon!

##### Ambiguity 

Sometimes, DEVOID finds multiple possible equivalences. With swapping constructors in particular, there can
be an exponential number of possible equivalences.

In the case of ambiguity, DEVOID presents up to the first 50 possible
options for the user (in a smart order), presents this as an error, and gives instructions for the user to
provide more information to `Find ornament` in the next iteration. If the equivalence you want is not in the
first 50 candidates, please use `Save ornament`. See [Swap.v](/plugin/coq/Swap.v) for examples of both of these.

##### Tactic Support

DEVOID produces tactic suggestions for all proofs that `Find ornament` finds.
These are experimental, especially with dependent types, but may help you work with tactic proofs about equivalences.

#### Lift and Repair

See [Example.v](/plugin/coq/examples/Example.v), [minimal_records.v](/plugin/coq/minimal_records.v),
and [Swap.v](/plugin/coq/Swap.v) for examples of lifting.

##### Command

```
Lift A B in f as g.
``` 

This command lifts a function or proof `f` along the discovered relation.
DEVOID must be able to find an ornament between `A` and `B` for this
command to work. If you have already called `Find ornament` on `A` and `B`,
it will use the discovered ornament; otherwise, it will search for an
ornament first.

##### Outputs

`Lift` produces a function `g` which is the analogue of `f`.

##### Alternate Syntax

You can run this with an alternate syntax as well:


```
Lift A B in f as ..suffix.
``` 

This will name the result `f_suffix`.

##### Whole Module Lifting

You can lift an endure module across an ornament all at the same time by running
this command:

```
Lift Module A B in Foo as Bar.
```

This will create a new module `Bar` with all of the liftings from `Foo`.

##### Tactic Support

If you would like tactic suggestions for lifted proofs, you may substitute `Repair` for `Lift` in all commands.
These tactic suggestions are experimental, but may help you with workflow integration.

##### Prettier Types

By default, DEVOID lets Coq infer the types of lifted terms. You can 
instead tell DEVOID to lift the types (these are typically prettier)
if you set the following function:

```
Set DEVOID lift type.
```

##### Opaque Terms

If you'd like, you can tell the `Lift` command to treat certain terms as opaque
when you are positive that lifting them will have no effect:

```
Lift A B in f as g { opaque constant1 constant2 ... }.
``` 

This can make lifting much faster.
It is **strongly advisable** to do this for certain terms that you know DEVOID
should never reduce.
However, this can also cause unpredictable errors if your assumption is incorrect,
so be careful about your assumption.

You can also set a term to be globally opaque every time you lift between A and B
by using the following command:

```
Configure Lift A B { opaque constant1 constant2 ... }.
```

You can find an example of this in [more_records.v](/plugin/coq/more_records.v).

##### Caching

DEVOID by default caches all lifted terms it encounters as it goes in order to save time.
You can disable this if you'd like by running this command:

```
Unset DEVOID smart cache. 
```

#### Additional Functionality

This functionality is demonstrated in [Example.v](/plugin/coq/examples/Example.v).

##### Preprocess

The `Lift` command does not support pattern matching and fixpoints directly.
To lift a function `f'` that uses pattern matching and (certain) fixpoints, run:

```
Preprocess f' as f.
```

Then, run:

```
Lift A B in f as g.
```

You can also run `Preprocess` on an entire module; see [ListToVect.v](/plugin/coq/examples/ListToVect.v)
for an example of this. See the [fix-to-elim](https://github.com/uwplse/coq-plugin-lib) plugin
for more functionality for `Preprocess`.

##### User-Friendly Types

When lifting across algebraic ornaments, to recover a slightly more user-friendly type for a lifted term `g`
with very little extra work, run:

```
Unpack g as g_u.
```

The type after `Unpack` still may not be very user-friendly.
If you would like to put in a little more work to get back types
that are very user friendly, check out the methodology in
[Example.v](/plugin/coq/examples/Example.v). The key is to
set the following option:

```
Set DEVOID search smart eliminators.
```

This generates a useful induction principle. Using that induction princple and composing
this by lifting across another equivalence, you can get from your unlifted type A to B at a
particular index, with much nicer type signatures.

### Assumptions

DEVOID makes some assumptions about your terms and types for now (described in Section 3 of the paper).
[Assumptions.v](/plugin/coq/examples/Assumptions.v) describes these assumptions in more detail
and gives examples of unsupported terms and types.
Note that the assumptions for records and tuples are not yet documented, since
support for those types is brand new.

These assumptions are mostly to simplify search. We hope to loosen them eventually.
If any are an immediate inconvenience to you, then please cut a GitHub issue with an example
you would like to see supported so that we can prioritize accordingly.

### Known Issues

Please see our GitHub [issues](https://github.com/uwplse/ornamental-search/issues) before reporting a bug
(though please do report any bugs not listed there).

One outstanding issue (an unimplemented optimization) has consequences for how we lift and unpack large
constants compositionally. For now, for large constants, you should prefer lifting several times and then unpacking
the result several times over iteratively lifting and unpacking. See [this issue](https://github.com/uwplse/ornamental-search/issues/44).

There are also still some open questions about eta expansion and definitional equality. Practically, from a user's perspective,
that means that lifting may sometimes fail with mysterious type errors for types that look almost but not quite correct.
Rest assured, we are working on fixing this, or at the least understanding why it happens well enough to significantly improve
error messaging and rule out invalid inputs.

# Examples

This part of the README explains the examples and how they correspond to the paper.
You may find these useful as a user, as a reader, or as a developer.

## Paper Examples

The example from the paper are in the [examples](/plugin/coq/examples) directory.
Here is an overview of the examples, in order of relevance to the paper:

## Tuple and Record Examples

The most useful examples of lifting between tuples and records are in [minimal_records.v](/plugin/coq/minimal_records.v)
and [more_records.v](/plugin/coq/more_records.v).

## Swapping and Renaming Constructors Examples

The most useful examples of swapping and renaming constructors are in [Swap.v](/plugin/coq/Swap.v).

## Other Examples

The [coq](/plugin/coq) directory has more examples.
These examples are regression tests, and so are not guaranteed to be useful
to users. However, if you would like more examples, you may look there as well.

The [eval](/plugin/eval) directory has examples from the case study from Section 6 of the paper.
They may be a bit hard to read since there is some scripting going on.
They may still be interesting to you whether or not you want to actually run the case study.

# Case Study

This section of the README describes how to reproduce the case study from Section 4 of the paper.
The case study is in the [eval](/plugin/eval) directory.
We support the case study scripts on only Linux right now.

## Building the Case Study Code

To run the case study code, you need the following additional dependencies:
* The Equivalences for Free! [univalent parametricity framework](https://github.com/CoqHott/univalent_parametricity) (hereon EFF)
* [Datamash](https://www.gnu.org/software/datamash/)

Run the following to make EFF:

```
cd <path-to-EFF>
make && make install
```

Datamash should install in a straightforward way from a package manager using the link above.

## Reproducing the Paper Case Study

The particular commit for EFF used for the results in the paper is [this commit](https://github.com/CoqHott/univalent_parametricity/tree/02383400c2711a1de1581e62e0a463759211d4df). We have rerun the experiments using 
[this commit](https://github.com/CoqHott/univalent_parametricity/tree/993ec06760953331c588b47ba4ad423f7d2c0c46), 
the newest commit at the time of release, and there results have not changed significantly. Results are not guaranteed to
be the same for different commits of EFF, especially later ones which may include optimizations not yet implemented
at the time of writing. Similarly, on different architectures, the numbers may be slightly different; the orders of 
magnitude should be comparable.

Enter the [eval](/plugin/eval) directory:

```
cd eval
```

Increase your stack size:

```
ulimit -s 100000
```

Run the following script:

```
./together.sh
```

The script takes a while, as it runs each function ten times each
on large data both for DEVOID and for EFF.
When it is done, check the `results` folder for the median runtimes as well as the size of reduced functions.
This also does a sanity check to make sure both versions of the code produce the same output.
It does not yet try to reduce the proof of `pre_permutes` using EFF,
otherwise the case study would take a very long time to run.
To run this just once, enter the [equiv4free](/plugin/eval/equiv4free) directory:

```
cd equiv4free
```

In that directory, uncomment the following line in [main.v](/plugin/eval/equiv4free/main.v):

```
(*Redirect "../out/normalized/pre_permutes-sizedEFFequiv" Eval compute in pre_permutes'.*)
```

Then run the following script, which runs the EFF code just once:

```
./prepermutes.sh
```

This should take a while (how long depends on your architecture) and produce a very large term.

## Understanding the Case Study Code

The code for the case study is in the [eval](/plugin/eval) folder.
The case study uses the same exact input datatypes for both DEVOID and EFF,
copying and pasting in the inputs, lifted functions, and equivalences DEVOID produces to run on the dependencies of EFF.
The reasons for copying the inputs are that EFF has different
Coq dependencies, so the base functions perform differently. In addition, lifting constants with EFF additionally slows down 
performance, and we would like to control for only the performance of lifted functions, which is easiest to understand.

There is one other thing worth understanding about the case study code.
We used to use this command to measure the performance of `foo`:

```
Eval vm_compute in foo.
```

An ITP reviewer noted that this includes the amount of time to print `foo`. This is a lot of
overhead that clouds the usefulness of the data. The reviewer suggested writing:

```
Eval vm_compute in (let _ := foo in tt).
```

Unfortunately, Coq seems to be a bit too smart for that; it doesn't actually bother computing `foo`
if you do that. Instead, we now write:

```
Eval vm_compute in (List.tl [foo]).
```

This forces Coq to compute `foo`, but ultimately prints `[]`, thereby not adding printing time.
It does add the time to run `List.tl`, but this overhead is very minimal on a list of a single element
(much more minimal than the overhead of printing).

# Implementation and Development

Transparency is very important to me and my coauthors. My goal is not just to produce a useful a tool,
but also to demonstrate ideas that other people can use in their tools.

Some information for transparency is in the paper:
Section 4 discusses the core algorithms that DEVOID implements, and
section 5 discusses a sample of implementation challenges.

This part of the README is here to complement that. It describes the structure of the code a bit. It should also help if you are interested in contributing
to DEVOID, or if you are interested in using some of the libraries from DEVOID in your code.

## Understanding the Code

This is an outline of the structure of the code. Please cut an issue if you are confused about anything here.
Please also feel free to ask if you are confused about anything that the code does.

## Regression Testing

The test script in the [plugin](/plugin) directory runs all of the regression tests:

```
./test.sh
```

After making a change to DEVOID, you should always run this. You should
also run the case study scripts to check performance.

## Licensing and Attribution

DEVOID is MIT licensed, since I have a very strong preference for the MIT license and
since I believe I do not need to use Coq's LGPL when writing language plugins.
This interpretation might be wrong, though, so I suppose you should tread lightly.
If you are an expert in licensing, definitely let me know if this is wrong.

Regardless, I would like DEVOID to be used freely by anyone for any purpose.
All I ask for is attribution, especially in any papers that you publish that use DEVOID
or any of its code. Please cite the ITP paper when referring to DEVOID in those papers.
