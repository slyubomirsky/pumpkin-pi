(*
 * This is an example for lifting between nested tuples and records.
 *)

(*
 * In this example, we have some generated code that uses nested tuples:
 *)
Module Generated.

Definition input := (prod bool (prod nat bool)).

Definition output := (prod nat bool).

Definition firstBool (r : (prod bool (prod nat bool))) : bool :=
  (fst r).

Definition numberI (r : (prod bool (prod nat bool))) : nat :=
  (fst (snd r)).

Definition secondBool (r : (prod bool (prod nat bool))) : bool :=
  (snd (snd r)).

Definition numberO (r : (prod nat bool)) : nat :=
  (fst r).

Definition andBools (r : (prod nat bool)) : bool :=
  (snd r).

Definition op (r : (prod bool (prod nat bool))) : (prod nat bool) :=
  (pair
    (numberI r)
    (andb
      (firstBool  r)
      (secondBool r)
    )
  ).

End Generated.

(*
 * We want to write proofs over the record versions of these, which
 * are easier to read about. We start by defining the record versions
 * of input and output ourselves:
 *)
Module Handwritten.

Record input := MkInput
{
  firstBool  : bool;
  numberI    : nat;
  secondBool : bool;
}.

Record output := MkOutput
{
  numberO  : nat;
  andBools : bool;
}.

End Handwritten.

(*
 * Now we Preprocess in both directions, since we'll lift in
 * both directions.
 *)
Preprocess Module Generated as Generated'.
Preprocess Module Handwritten as Handwritten'.

(*
 * The easiest way to lift these is to just lift the module twice, first for
 * input (bigger type) then for output (smaller type):
 *)
Lift Module Generated'.input Handwritten'.input in Generated' as Temp1.
Lift Module Generated'.output Handwritten'.output in Temp1 as Handwritten''.

(*
 * If you lift in the opposite order, for op, you get something well-typed but with
 * a type you don't even want. So for now when one type definition you lift along
 * is a subterm of another type definition you lift along, you will need to start
 * with the bigger one and then tell CARROT to treat the lifted projections as opaque.
 * Really interesting WIP on handling this better without so much work for the user.
 *
 * See: [redacted]

(*
 * OK, now that we're in the handwritten world, we can write our proofs over
 * these nicer types:
 *)

(*
 * Let's Preprocess this proof for lifting:
 *)
Preprocess Module HandwrittenProofs as HandwrittenProofs'.

(*
 * Then lift it back to our nested pair types.
 * I think this is order sensitive if we want something that looks nice, since we
 * lifted op in one order so we only have nice cached intermediate constants if we go
 * in the opposite order. But it will work regardless of which direction you do.

(*
 * Otherwise we get our proof over generated types with just one catch: We need to call

 * (induction principles) and we want something defined over the original types
 * (pattern matching and so on).
